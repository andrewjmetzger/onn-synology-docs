Your server is preloaded with a selection of media to choose from. Having trouble finding something you like? 

**Overseerr** is a user-friendly request system that can automatically search for and grab the media you're after.


1. Search for and request any Movie or TV Show.

2. Each request will be automatically downloaded (where available), and added to your Plex library. You can also opt to recieve notifications via email or mobile (push) when your media is ready to enjoy.

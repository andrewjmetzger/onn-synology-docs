# Mullvad VPN

Your Synology NAS has been setup to use Mullvad VPN. Mullvad is designed to keep your online activities private by using secure connections that stop your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from seeing what you're doing online.

Your Mullvad account number is: <strong><code>{frontMatter.account}</code></strong>.

Make sure to keep this number safe because it's the only way to access your Mullvad account and the time you have purchased. If you lose your account number, you won't be able to recover it since Mullvad doesn't keep any personal information about you.


## Add time to your account

  - Mullvad's [pricing](https://mullvad.net/en/pricing) is a flat &euro;5 per month, regardless of how much time you purchase.
  - There is no limit to the total time you can add to your account. To purchase more than a year, just checkout again.

Mullvad does not offer an auto-renewal option for their VPN service, meaning you'll need to manually add time to your account when it expires. To ensure uninterrupted service, it's a good idea to set a reminder in your calendar a few days before your account time runs out. This way, you can log in and extend your service without any gaps. Remember, your account number is essential for accessing your account, so keep it safe and handy when you need to renew.

# Welcome!

To set up your Synology NAS and ensure Plex is working, follow these steps:

## Hardware Overview

1. **Plug in the NAS**: Locate the power port on the back of your NAS (labeled as 10 in the diagram). Connect the power adapter to this port and plug it into a wall outlet. Press the power button on the front (labeled as 5) to turn on the NAS. Ensure it is placed in a stable and ventilated area to prevent overheating.

2. **Connect the Ethernet Cable**: Find the leftmost RJ-45 port on the back of the NAS (labeled as 7). Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to this port and the other end to your router. This connection allows the NAS to communicate with your network and access the internet.

3. **Wait for the Beep**: Once powered on, the NAS will go through its startup process. Wait for the beep sound, which indicates that the NAS is ready for use. This may take a few minutes, so be patient.

4. **Check Plex Functionality**: After three minutes, access the NAS's web interface from your computer by entering `http://192.168.1.187:32400/web`. 

By following these steps, your NAS should be set up correctly, and Plex should be ready to stream your media content across your devices.
